# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Large-graph handling

- **Container map by default.** Graphs above ~2,500 nodes now open at the
  container level: fine-grained nodes (fields, Apex methods, flow elements, record
  types, list views) are rolled up into their parent object/class/flow, and their
  edges are rolled up with them (self-loops dropped, parallels de-duplicated). This
  turns a multi-tens-of-thousands-node hairball into a readable module-level map
  and avoids freezing the editor.
- **"Show all" toggle.** A toolbar button switches between the container map and
  the full graph. On a large graph, expanding to everything asks for confirmation
  first, since rendering it all at once can be slow.
- **Faster rendering at scale.** Large maps use a draft force layout, the cheap
  "haystack" edge renderer (no arrowheads), edges hidden while panning/zooming, and
  fit-to-view on open. Labels only appear once zoomed in.
- The toolbar status now shows the current view (containers / full) and the total
  node count behind a rolled-up map; container nodes note how many members were
  collapsed into them.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: interactive, filterable graph view for a `graph.json` metadata
  graph — pan/zoom/drag map, type and edge filters, node search, and a detail panel
  with attributes and relationships.
- In-plugin graph generation (TypeScript port of the Salesforce extractors) and a
  Graphs library stored in the extension's private storage.
