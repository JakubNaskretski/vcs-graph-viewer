# Graph Explorer

An Obsidian-style **graph view inside your editor**. Point it at a `graph.json`
metadata graph (nodes + edges) and explore it as an interactive, filterable map —
click any node to read its attributes and relationships.

## What it shows

- **Graph map** — a force-directed layout you can pan, zoom, and drag. Nodes are
  sized by how connected they are and colored by type. The layout settles, then the
  nodes keep a gentle Obsidian-style drift; hovering highlights a node and its
  neighbors (and dims the rest) without disturbing the layout.
- **Scales to large graphs** — graphs above ~2,500 nodes open as a **container map**:
  fine-grained nodes (fields, Apex methods, flow elements, record types, list views)
  roll up into their parent object/class/flow, edges and all, so you get a readable
  module-level view instead of a frozen hairball. A **Show all** toggle in the
  toolbar expands to every node (behind a confirmation, since it can be heavy).
- **Expand a container in place** — in the container map, select a rolled-up node
  (an Apex class, object, or flow) and reveal, *on top of* the overview, its members
  (methods/fields/elements) with **⊕**, plus its most-connected neighbors and the
  nodes that point into it with the **＋ / −** steppers — the rest of the map stays.
  Expand those in turn to **walk the graph one step at a time**; **⊖** rolls a node's
  members back up and **reset** returns to the overview. *Max Related Nodes* controls
  how many neighbors/sources each **＋** step reveals; member expansion is bounded by
  *Max Render Nodes* so a huge container can't freeze the layout.
- **Filters** — toggle node types and edge types on/off to focus the map; search
  nodes by name. Work in either the container map or the full graph. Each **node
  type expands** into a searchable list of its own nodes, so you can drill into,
  say, *Apex class* and tick exactly which classes to show (with per-type all/none
  and a name search built to handle thousands of members).
- **Focus a single node** — click a node and hit **Focus** (or type its name in the
  search box and press **Enter**) to narrow the map to just that node and its
  neighborhood. A depth control widens the ring one hop at a time (from 1 hop
  upward); a direction toggle picks what it *calls/uses*, what *calls/uses it*, or
  both; **clear** restores the full view — for when you want *just this one
  object/class and what it touches*.
- **Node details** — click a node to see its attributes plus every incoming and
  outgoing relationship, grouped by edge type. Click a related node to jump to it.
- **Diagnostics** — when a graph carries unresolved references (edges pointing at
  something not in the source) or files that failed to parse, a **⚠** button appears
  in the toolbar; click it for a collapsible list of what couldn't be resolved or
  extracted.
- **Graphs side panel** — a library of your graphs in the Activity Bar. Generate,
  import, open, and delete from there. Graphs are kept in the extension's private
  storage, so they never land in your repo.

## Getting a graph

Two ways:

1. **Generate it in-plugin** (no external tooling). Open the **Graphs** view in the
   Activity Bar → **Generate from folder…**, or right-click a source folder in the
   Explorer → **Generate Graph from Folder**. You're asked which metadata source
   types to include (all on by default) — narrow it to just Apex, flows, objects,
   etc. when you want a focused graph. The built-in builder parses a Salesforce
   `force-app` into the graph and stores it in your library.
2. **Import an existing `graph.json`** produced by **graph-builder**
   (`python -m graphbuilder path/to/source -o graph.json`) via the **Graphs** view
   → **Import**, or open one ad-hoc with **Graph Explorer: Open**.

The graph is plain JSON; any tool that emits the same shape works:

```jsonc
{
  "nodes": [{ "id": "object/Account", "type": "object", "label": "Account" }],
  "edges": [{ "src": "field/Account.Name", "dst": "object/Account", "type": "field_of" }]
}
```

## Usage

- **Graphs view** (Activity Bar) → **Generate from folder…** to build one, or
  **Import** an existing `graph.json`. Click a graph in the list to open the map.
- Or **Graph Explorer: Open** from the Command Palette to open a `graph.json`
  ad-hoc (its path is remembered in `graphViewer.graphPath`). The view reloads
  automatically when that file changes (`graphViewer.reloadOnChange`).

## Settings

| Setting                       | Default | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `graphViewer.graphPath`       | `""`    | Path to the graph file. Relative paths resolve against the workspace. |
| `graphViewer.reloadOnChange`  | `true`  | Reload the view when the graph file changes on disk.    |
| `graphViewer.physics`         | `true`  | Gentle Obsidian-style drift after the layout settles. Auto-disables on large graphs (see Motion Max Nodes). Off = fully static. |
| `graphViewer.spacing`         | `220`   | Spacing between nodes (20–500). Higher spreads the graph out more. |
| `graphViewer.animateOnHover`  | `true`  | On hover, dim the rest of the graph and enlarge + highlight the node and its neighbors. |
| `graphViewer.motionMaxNodes`  | `800`   | Above this node count the gentle drift turns off so large graphs stay responsive. |
| `graphViewer.maxRelatedNodes` | `10`    | How many related main nodes each neighbor/source **＋** step reveals when you expand a container node (≥1). |
| `graphViewer.maxRenderNodes`  | `1500`  | Hard cap on nodes drawn at once (≥100). Above it, only the most-connected nodes render; search and drill-in still reach everything. "Show all" bypasses it. |

Appearance settings apply live — no reload needed.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run watch     # bundle extension + webview, rebuild on change
```

Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch an Extension Development Host, then open the
**Graphs** view and generate or import a graph.

The in-plugin builder is a TypeScript port of graph-builder's Salesforce
extractors, so generating a graph needs no Python. It covers objects, fields,
Apex, triggers, flows, LWC, Aura, Visualforce, OmniStudio, permission
sets/profiles, layouts, reports, rules, and more. (Apex is parsed from a real
syntax tree via ANTLR — `@apexdevtools/apex-parser` — for accurate method,
call, SOQL/DML, and `var.method()` resolution, including generics in
`implements`; a regex parser is the automatic fallback for any `.cls` the
grammar can't cleanly parse.)
