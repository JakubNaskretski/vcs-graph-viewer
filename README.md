# Graph Viewer

An Obsidian-style **graph view inside your editor**. Point it at a `graph.json`
metadata graph (nodes + edges) and explore it as an interactive, filterable map —
click any node to read its attributes and relationships.

## What it shows

- **Graph map** — a force-directed layout you can pan, zoom, and drag. Nodes are
  sized by how connected they are and colored by type. Physics settle the layout
  and react to hover/drag (Obsidian-style).
- **Filters** — toggle node types and edge types on/off to focus the map; search
  nodes by name.
- **Node details** — click a node to see its attributes plus every incoming and
  outgoing relationship, grouped by edge type. Click a related node to jump to it.
- **Graphs side panel** — a library of your graphs in the Activity Bar. Generate,
  import, open, and delete from there. Graphs are kept in the extension's private
  storage, so they never land in your repo.

## Getting a graph

Two ways:

1. **Generate it in-plugin** (no external tooling). Open the **Graphs** view in the
   Activity Bar → **Generate from folder…**, or right-click a source folder in the
   Explorer → **Generate Graph from Folder**. The built-in builder parses a
   Salesforce `force-app` into the graph and stores it in your library.
2. **Import an existing `graph.json`** produced by **graph-builder**
   (`python -m graphbuilder path/to/source -o graph.json`) via the **Graphs** view
   → **Import**, or open one ad-hoc with **Graph Viewer: Open**.

The graph is plain JSON; any tool that emits the same shape works:

```jsonc
{
  "nodes": [{ "id": "object/Account", "type": "object", "label": "Account" }],
  "edges": [{ "src": "field/Account.Name", "dst": "object/Account", "type": "field_of" }]
}
```

## Usage

- **Graphs view** (Activity Bar) → **Generate from folder…** to build one, or
  **Import** an existing `graph.json`. Click a graph in the list to open the map.
- Or **Graph Viewer: Open** from the Command Palette to open a `graph.json`
  ad-hoc (its path is remembered in `graphViewer.graphPath`). The view reloads
  automatically when that file changes (`graphViewer.reloadOnChange`).

## Settings

| Setting                       | Default | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `graphViewer.graphPath`       | `""`    | Path to the graph file. Relative paths resolve against the workspace. |
| `graphViewer.reloadOnChange`  | `true`  | Reload the view when the graph file changes on disk.    |
| `graphViewer.physics`         | `true`  | Keep the graph in continuous motion so it settles and reacts to dragging/hovering. Off = static layout. |
| `graphViewer.spacing`         | `100`   | Spacing between nodes (20–500). Higher spreads the graph out more. |
| `graphViewer.animateOnHover`  | `true`  | Gently nudge and highlight a node's neighbors on hover (needs Physics for the motion). |

Appearance settings apply live — no reload needed.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run watch     # bundle extension + webview, rebuild on change
```

Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch an Extension Development Host, then open the
**Graphs** view and generate or import a graph.

The in-plugin builder is a TypeScript port of graph-builder's Salesforce
extractors, so generating a graph needs no Python. It covers objects, fields,
Apex, triggers, flows, LWC, Aura, Visualforce, OmniStudio, permission
sets/profiles, layouts, reports, rules, and more. (Apex uses a regex parser, so
deep instance-call resolution is lighter than graph-builder's optional
tree-sitter backend.)
